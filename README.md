# Fullstack Assessment - Software Mind

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of a fullstack assessment for the company *Software Mind*. The goal was to build a robust application that demonstrates proficiency in both backend and frontend development, while adhering to clean architecture principles and best practices in software development.

## Database Design

The database schema was designed using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that allows for easy and efficient interaction with the database. Below is the database diagram showcasing the relationships and structure of the database.

## Backend

For the backend, I utilized **Next.js** with the **App Router** and focused on server-side application routing. The project is organized using **Clean Architecture** principles, which includes clear separations of concerns such as:

- **Controllers**: Handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Services**: Encapsulating the business logic.
- **Use-Cases**: Representing specific application functionalities.
- **Repositories**: Managing data access and interaction with the database.

This structure ensures maintainability, scalability, and flexibility in the project.

## Frontend

The frontend was also built with **Next.js** using the **App Router**. I employed **Tailwind CSS** for a fast and responsive design, ensuring the application is visually appealing and accessible across all screen sizes. Additionally, **TypeScript** was used across the entire codebase to ensure type safety and better development experience.

## Conclusion

I would like to thank *Software Mind* for the opportunity to showcase my skills and knowledge through this fullstack assessment. It was an invaluable learning experience, and I hope the project reflects my passion for clean, efficient, and well-structured code.
